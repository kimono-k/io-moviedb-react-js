# iO MovieDB

## Acknowledgements

First of all, I would like to thank my mentor Philip Ghering for offering me advice, guidance, and help during the completion of the project.

## About the project

Do you like binge-watching Netflix shows? Then iO MovieDB is the place to be! You can search for your favorite movies and even give your own remarks. Great when you want to give your own reviews or give your interpretation about the movie.
